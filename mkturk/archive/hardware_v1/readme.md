The basic mkturk hardware setup requires an electronics board that receives a trigger from the tablet and dispenses a reward. In mkturk_v1, this was accomplished using either an audio (trigger from sound jack) or a photo (tigger photodiode by white bar on screen) trigger to an arduino micro which then gated open a 5V signal to drive a low power pump. Triggering with a photodiode is recommended as we found more consistent behavior than using the audio line as a trigger. Recently, we have moved to using bluetooth (specifically, bluetooth low energy) for communication as this allows triggering without any cables connected to the tablet and frees up either the audio for playing sounds or the photodiode. The only caveat of BLE is its latency (100 ms estimated) which suffices for low bandwidth, infrequent communication like pump triggering.

Although we use pumps for fluid delivery, an alternative is to open and close a valve that gates a gravity fed water source as is found in some commercial systems. Finally, the whole system can be powered by a USB battery pack since both the tablet and the arduino take microusb input.
